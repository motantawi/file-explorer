- Personal Implementation Notes
-
- This file contains my personal approach to building the File Explorer.
- I chose to focus on creating a professional, scalable solution that
- demonstrates modern React and TypeScript best practices.
-
- My key design principles:
- 1.  User Experience First - Every interaction should feel intuitive
- 2.  Code Quality - Write maintainable, readable code
- 3.  Performance - Optimize for real-world usage
- 4.  Accessibility - Ensure the app works for everyone
- 5.  Scalability - Build for future growth

// Why I chose this approach for file type detection
fileTypeSystem: `    I implemented a comprehensive file type system because:
    - Users need visual cues to quickly identify file types
    - Color coding improves usability and accessibility
    - Extensible design allows for easy addition of new file types
    - Categories enable advanced filtering and organization
 `,

// My approach to validation
validationStrategy: `    I built robust validation because:
    - Prevents user frustration from cryptic error messages
    - Ensures data integrity throughout the application
    - Follows platform-specific naming conventions (Windows/Mac/Linux)
    - Provides clear, actionable feedback to users
 `,

// Why I refactored the architecture
architectureDecision: `    I restructured the codebase because:
    - Single large files become unmaintainable over time
    - Modular architecture enables better testing and debugging
    - Clear separation of concerns makes the code self-documenting
    - Easier for team collaboration and code reviews
 `,

// My responsive design philosophy
mobileFirstApproach: `    I designed mobile-first because:
    - Mobile usage continues to grow across all demographics
    - Progressive enhancement ensures optimal experience on all devices
    - Touch interactions require different UX patterns than mouse/keyboard
    - Performance constraints on mobile require careful optimization
